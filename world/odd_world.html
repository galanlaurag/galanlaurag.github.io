        <p class="desc">This is unusual... you appeared just in the middle of nowhere - alone. Your skin is greenish, there is hot and pretty hard to breathe.<br>
          What's more, this planet seems to be uninhabited... It is completely empty, there aren't any plants or living creatures in your sight.
          There is a wide deep ocean around, its water is drinkable - it is salty but surprisingly delicious.
          Lack of any source of food is your biggest issue - how can you survive without food?</p>
        <p class="desc">Your condition is getting worse and worse, you haven't eaten for days, you feel like you're dying.<br>
          You slowly start losing your mind - it's so bad and you're so hungry that you consider eating this disgusting green muddy slime that all the ground is covered with...
          Do you want to try eating it, or would you rather starve to death? It wouldn't be long now...</p>
