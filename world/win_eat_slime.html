        <p class="desc">Wow! Turned out that this muddy weird slime turns the lungs into the gills!<br>
        It was hard to breathe before, but now it's impossible - you can't breathe any longer staying on the land.
        You dive into this mysterious yellow water.
        What you discover under the water surface is even more surprising - all the life on this planet is just here!
        There are many people like you, other living creatures, and plants.</p>
        <p class="desc">You are welcomed extremely warmly and become a part of a family.
          It was just a test everyone coming on this planet experience - whether you are brave and motivated enough to survive.
          You passed!</p>

        <p class="desc, won">You won a Universe Life!</p>
