        <p class="desc">You stayed in the hospital for a few long years, managed to get through the worst. Your family's support keeps you alive.<br>
          Still, the situation on the planet didn't change much, it's even worse. There are new viruses coming up all the time, chances are that you are in higher risk staying in the hospital among all these sick, potentialy contagious people.</p>
        <p class="desc">Now, that you have grown up enough to be able to decide for yourself - you can either stay in the hospital (maybe even forever) or leave at your own risk.
          If you choose leaving, you can either go back home to your family and probably die there because of your unstable condition and lack of professional help, or escape to the forest to try healing with wild herbs on your own.</p>
