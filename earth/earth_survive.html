        <p class="desc">You stayed in the hospital for a few long years, managed to get through the worst. Your family's support keeps you alive.<br>
          Still, the situation on the planet didn't change much, it's even worse. New viruses are coming up all the time - chances are that you are at higher risk while staying in the hospital among all these sick, potentially contagious people.</p>
        <p class="desc">Now, that you have grown up enough to be able to decide for yourself - you can either stay in the hospital (maybe even forever) or leave at your own risk.
          If you choose to leave, you can go back home to your family and probably die there because of your unstable condition and lack of professional help. You can also escape to the forest to try healing with wild herbs on your own.</p>
