        <p class="desc">It wasn't a calm night. You tried to climb the tree, but you didn't know how - it wasn't a skill you could learn staying in the hospital.
          You could hear some misterious noises all around you that didn't let you sleep a wink.<br>
          Unfortunately, within a short time, the noises became closer and you realised these are crocodiles who make it.
          There were three of them - you'd have no way of escaping and surviving this... They attacked you and you can guess what happened next.</p>

        <p class="death">You didn't manage to survive in the Universe.</p>
